Compare Values 8.1 Compare Values Conditional logic is based on performing diﬀerent actions depending on whether or not some expression, called a conditional, is true or false. This idea is not speciﬁc to computers. Humans use conditional logic all the time to make decisions. For example, the legal age for purchasing alcoholic beverages in the United States is 21. The statement “If you are at least 21 years old, then you may purchase a beer” is an example of conditional logic. The phrase “you are at least 21 years old” is a conditional because it may be either true or false. In computer programming, conditionals often take the form of com- paring two values, such as determining if one value is greater than another, or whether or not two values are equal to each other. A stan- dard set of symbols called boolean comparators are used to make comparisons, and most of them may already be familiar to you. The following table describes these boolean comparators: The following table describes these boolean comparators: > a > b a greater than b < a < b a less than b >= a >= b <= a <= b a less than or equal to b != a != b a not equal to b == a == b a equal to b Boolean Boolean Comparator Example Meaning a greater than or equal to b The term boolean is derived from the last name of the English mathematician George Boole, whose works helped lay the founda- tions of modern computing. In Boole’s honor, conditional logic is sometimes called boolean logic, and conditionals are sometimes called boolean expressions. There is also a fundamental data type called the boolean, or bool for short, which can have only one of two values. In Python, these values\n\nDocument: Python Basics A Practical Introduction To Python 3\n--- Concept ---\nChapter 8 Chapter 8 Conditional Logic and Control Flow Nearly all of the code y"

Store Relationships in Dictionaries 9.6. Store Relationships in Dictionaries Key Value \"Texas\" \"Austin\" In the table above, the keys of the dictionary are the names of the states, and the values of the dictionary are the names of the capitals. The diﬀerence between an English dictionary and a Python dictionary is that the relationship between a key and its value is completely arbi- trary. Any key can be assigned to any value. For example, the following table of key-value pairs is valid: For example, the following table of key-value pairs is valid: Key Value 1 \"red\" 12:45pm 17 True \"Sunday\" The keys in this table don’t appear to be related to the values at all. The only relationship is that each key is assigned to its corresponding value by the dictionary. In this sense, a Python dictionary is much more like a map than it is an English dictionary. The term map here comes from mathemat- ics. It is used to describe a relation between two sets of values, not a geographical map. In practice, it is this idea of dictionaries as a map that is particularly useful. Under this lens, the English dictionary is a special case of a map that relates words to their deﬁnitions. So in summary, a Python dictionary is a data structure that relates a set of keys to a set of values. Each key is assigned a single value, which deﬁnes a relationship between the two sets. Now that you have an idea what a dictionary is, let’s see how to create Now that you have an idea what a dictionary is, let’s see how to create 9.6. Store Relationships in Dictionaries 9.6.

To help avoid this problem, you can leave comments in your code. Comments are lines of text that don’t aﬀect the way the script runs. They help to document what’s supposed to be happening. In this section, you will learn three ways to leave comments in your code. You will also learn some conventions for formatting comments, as well as some pet peeves regarding their over-use.\n\nDocument: Python Basics A Practical Introduction To Python 3"
