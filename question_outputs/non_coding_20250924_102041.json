Create a Variable Inthissection, you’lllearnhowtousevariablesinyourcode, aswellas some of the conventions Python programmers follow when choosing names for variables. The Assignment Operator The Assignment Operator Values are assigned to a variable using a special symbol = called the assignment operator. An operator is a symbol, like = or +, that performs some operation on one or more values. For example, the + operator takes two numbers, one to the left of the operator and one to the right, and adds them together. Likewise, the = operator takes a value to the right of the operator and assigns it to the name on the left of the operator. To see the assignment operator in action, let’s modify the “Hello, world” program you saw in the last section. This time, we’ll use a variable to store some text before printing it to the screen: >>> phrase = \"Hello, world\" >>> print(phrase) Hello, world In the ﬁrst line, a variable named phrase is created and assigned the value \"Hello, world\"usingthe =operator.
