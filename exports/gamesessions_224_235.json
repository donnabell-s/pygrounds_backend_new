Compare Values 8.1 Compare Values Conditional logic is based on performing di\ufb00erent actions depending on whether or not some expression, called a conditional, is true or false. This idea is not speci\ufb01c to computers. Humans use conditional logic all the time to make decisions. For example, the legal age for purchasing alcoholic beverages in the United States is 21. The statement \u201cIf you are at least 21 years old, then you may purchase a beer\u201d is an example of conditional logic. The phrase \u201cyou are at least 21 years old\u201d is a conditional because it may be either true or false. In computer programming, conditionals often take the form of com- paring two values, such as determining if one value is greater than another, or whether or not two values are equal to each other. A stan- dard set of symbols called boolean comparators are used to make comparisons, and most of them may already be familiar to you. The following table describes these b",

Variables are funda- mental to programming for two reasons: 1. Variables keep values accessible: For example, the result of some time-consuming operation can be assigned to a variable so that the operation does not need to be performed each time you need to use the result. 2. Variables give values context: The number 28 could mean lots ofdi\ufb00erentthings, suchasthenumberofstudentsinaclass, orthe number of times a user has accessed a website, and so on. Naming the value 28 something like num_students makes the meaning of the value clear. 3.3. Create a Variable 3.3. Create a Variable Inthissection, you\u2019lllearnhowtousevariablesinyourcode, aswellas some of the conventions Python programmers follow when choosing names for variables. The Assignment Operator The Assignment Operator Values are assigned to a variable using a special symbol = called the assignment operator. An operator is a symbol, like = or +, that performs some operation on one or more values. For example, the + operator takes two numbers, one to the left of the operator and one to the right, and adds them together. Likewise, the = operator takes a value to the right of the operator and assigns it to the name on the left of the operator. To see the assignment operator in action, let\u2019s modify the \u201cHello, world\u201d program you saw in the last section. This time, we\u2019ll use a variable to store some text before printing it to the screen: >>> phrase = \"Hello, world\" >>> print(phrase) Hello, world In the \ufb01rst line, a variable named phrase is created and assigned the value \"Hello, world\"usingthe =operator.

For instance, try evaluating the following expression: For instance, try evaluating the following expression: (\"A\" != \"A\") or not (2 >= 3) Start by evaluating the two expressions in parentheses. \"A\" != \"A\" is False because \"A\" is equal to itself. 2 >= 3 is also False because 2 is smaller than 3. This gives you the following equivalent, but simpler, expression: (False) or not (False) Since not has a higher precedence than or, the above expression is equivalent to the following: False or (not False) not False is True, so you can simplify the expression once more: not False is True, so you can simplify the expression once more:\n\nDocument: Python Basics A Practical Introduction To Python 3",

Variables are funda- mental to programming for two reasons: 1. Variables keep values accessible: For example, the result of some time-consuming operation can be assigned to a variable so that the operation does not need to be performed each time you need to use the result. 2. Variables give values context: The number 28 could mean lots ofdi\ufb00erentthings, suchasthenumberofstudentsinaclass, orthe number of times a user has accessed a website, and so on. Naming the value 28 something like num_students makes the meaning of the value clear. 3.3. Create a Variable 3.3. Create a Variable Inthissection, you\u2019lllearnhowtousevariablesinyourcode, aswellas some of the conventions Python programmers follow when choosing names for variables. The Assignment Operator The Assignment Operator Values are assigned to a variable using a special symbol = called the assignment operator. An operator is a symbol, like = or +, that performs some operation on one or more values. For example, the + operator takes two numbers, one to the left of the operator and one to the right, and adds them together. Likewise, the = operator takes a value to the right of the operator and assigns it to the name on the left of the operator. To see the assignment operator in action, let\u2019s modify the \u201cHello, world\u201d program you saw in the last section.

For instance, try evaluating the following expression: For instance, try evaluating the following expression: (\"A\" != \"A\") or not (2 >= 3) Start by evaluating the two expressions in parentheses. \"A\" != \"A\" is False because \"A\" is equal to itself. 2 >= 3 is also False because 2 is smaller than 3. This gives you the following equivalent, but simpler, expression: (False) or not (False) Since not has a higher precedence than or, the above expression is equivalent to the following: False or (not False) not False is True, so you can simplify the expression once more: not False is True, so you can simplify the expression once more:\n\nDocument: Python Basics A Practical Introduction To Python 3",

Variables are funda- mental to programming for two reasons: 1. Variables keep values accessible: For example, the result of some time-consuming operation can be assigned to a variable so that the operation does not need to be performed each time you need to use the result. 2. Variables give values context: The number 28 could mean lots ofdi\ufb00erentthings, suchasthenumberofstudentsinaclass, orthe number of times a user has accessed a website, and so on. Naming the value 28 something like num_students makes the meaning of the value clear. 3.3. Create a Variable 3.3. Create a Variable Inthissection, you\u2019lllearnhowtousevariablesinyourcode, aswellas some of the conventions Python programmers follow when choosing names for variables. The Assignment Operator The Assignment Operator Values are assigned to a variable using a special symbol = called the assignment operator. An operator is a symbol, like = or +, that performs some operation on one or more values. For example, the + operator takes two numbers, one to the left of the operator and one to the right, and adds them together. Likewise, the = operator takes a value to the right of the operator and assigns it to the name on the left of the operator. To see the assignment operator in action, let\u2019s modify the \u201cHello, world\u201d program you saw in the last section. This time, we\u2019ll use a variable to store some text before printing it to the screen: >>> phrase = \"Hello, world\" >>> print(phrase) Hello, world In the \ufb01rst line, a variable named phrase is created and assigned the value \"Hello, world\"usingthe =operator. Thestring \"Hello, world\"that was originally used inside of the parentheses in the print() functi",

For instance, try evaluating the following expression: For instance, try evaluating the following expression: (\"A\" != \"A\") or not (2 >= 3) Start by evaluating the two expressions in parentheses. \"A\" != \"A\" is False because \"A\" is equal to itself. 2 >= 3 is also False because 2 is smaller than 3. This gives you the following equivalent, but simpler, expression: (False) or not (False) Since not has a higher precedence than or, the above expression is equivalent to the following: False or (not False) not False is True, so you can simplify the expression once more: not False is True, so you can simplify the expression once more:\n\nDocument: Python Basics A Practical Introduction To Python 3\n--- Concept ---\n8.1. Compare Values 8.1 Compare Values Conditional logic is based on performing di\ufb00erent actions depending on whether or not some expression, called a conditional, is true or false. This idea is not speci\ufb01c to computers. Humans use conditional logic all the time to make decisions. For example, the legal age for purchasing alcoholic beverages in the United States is 21. The statement \u201cIf you are at least 21 years old, then you may purchase a beer\u201d is an example of conditional logic. The phrase \u201cyou are at least 21 years old\u201d is a conditional because it may be either true or false. In computer programming, conditionals often take the form of com- paring two values, such as determining if one value is greater than another, or whether or not two values are equal to each other. A stan- dard set of symbols called boolean comparators are used to make comparisons, and most of them may already be familiar to you. The following table describes these b",

Variables are funda- mental to programming for two reasons: 1. Variables keep values accessible: For example, the result of some time-consuming operation can be assigned to a variable so that the operation does not need to be performed each time you need to use the result. 2. Variables give values context: The number 28 could mean lots ofdi\ufb00erentthings, suchasthenumberofstudentsinaclass, orthe number of times a user has accessed a website, and so on. Naming the value 28 something like num_students makes the meaning of the value clear. 3.3. Create a Variable 3.3. Create a Variable Inthissection, you\u2019lllearnhowtousevariablesinyourcode, aswellas some of the conventions Python programmers follow when choosing names for variables. The Assignment Operator The Assignment Operator Values are assigned to a variable using a special symbol = called the assignment operator. An operator is a symbol, like = or +, that performs some operation on one or more values. For example, the + operator takes two numbers, one to the left of the operator and one to the right, and adds them together. Likewise, the = operator takes a value to the right of the operator and assigns it to the name on the left of the operator. To see the assignment operator in action, let\u2019s modify the \u201cHello, world\u201d program you saw in the last section. This time, we\u2019ll use a variable to store some text before printing it to the screen: >>> phrase = \"Hello, world\" >>> print(phrase) Hello, world In the \ufb01rst line, a variable named phrase is created and assigned the value \"Hello, world\"usingthe =operator.

In computer programming, conditionals often take the form of com- paring two values, such as determining if one value is greater than another, or whether or not two values are equal to each other.

For instance, try evaluating the following expression: For instance, try evaluating the following expression: (\"A\" != \"A\") or not (2 >= 3) Start by evaluating the two expressions in parentheses. \"A\" != \"A\" is False because \"A\" is equal to itself. 2 >= 3 is also False because 2 is smaller than 3. This gives you the following equivalent, but simpler, expression: (False) or not (False) Since not has a higher precedence than or, the above expression is equivalent to the following: False or (not False) not False is True, so you can simplify the expression once more: not False is True, so you can simplify the expression once more:\n\nDocument: Python Basics A Practical Introduction To Python 3\n--- Concept ---\n8.1. Compare Values 8.1 Compare Values Conditional logic is based on performing di\ufb00erent actions depending on whether or not some expression, called a conditional, is true or false. This idea is not speci\ufb01c to computers. Humans use conditional logic all the time to make decisions. For example, the legal age for purchasing alcoholic beverages in the United States is 21. The statement \u201cIf you are at least 21 years old, then you may purchase a beer\u201d is an example of conditional logic. The phrase \u201cyou are at least 21 years old\u201d is a conditional because it may be either true or false. In computer programming, conditionals often take the form of com- paring two values, such as determining if one value is greater than another, or whether or not two values are equal to each other. A stan- dard set of symbols called boolean comparators are used to make comparisons, and most of them may already be familiar to you. The following table describes these b",

For instance, try evaluating the following expression: For instance, try evaluating the following expression: (\"A\" != \"A\") or not (2 >= 3) Start by evaluating the two expressions in parentheses. \"A\" != \"A\" is False because \"A\" is equal to itself. 2 >= 3 is also False because 2 is smaller than 3. This gives you the following equivalent, but simpler, expression: (False) or not (False) Since not has a higher precedence than or, the above expression is equivalent to the following: False or (not False) not False is True, so you can simplify the expression once more: not False is True, so you can simplify the expression once more:\n\nDocument: Python Basics A Practical Introduction To Python 3\n--- Concept ---\n8.1. Compare Values 8.1 Compare Values Conditional logic is based on performing di\ufb00erent actions depending on whether or not some expression, called a conditional, is true or false. This idea is not speci\ufb01c to computers. Humans use conditional logic all the time to make decisions. For example, the legal age for purchasing alcoholic beverages in the United States is 21. The statement \u201cIf you are at least 21 years old, then you may purchase a beer\u201d is an example of conditional logic. The phrase \u201cyou are at least 21 years old\u201d is a conditional because it may be either true or false. In computer programming, conditionals often take the form of com- paring two values, such as determining if one value is greater than another, or whether or not two values are equal to each other. A stan- dard set of symbols called boolean comparators are used to make comparisons, and most of them may already be familiar to you. The following table describes these b",
